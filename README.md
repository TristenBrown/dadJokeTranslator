# dadJokeTranslator

This is a website that pulls from an api to get a random dad joke and 
can pull from another api to translate that dad joke into a few made up languages, such as groot, pirate, and shakespeare.

The website supports login functions that allow you to save the aforementioned jokes and create and save your own jokes.

You can view your saved jokes and use a search bar to find a specific joke.

The code is written in HTML5, CSS, javascript, jQuery, and PHP. I used a LAMP stack.
username/password and username/saved joke are stored into a database that the php pulls from
